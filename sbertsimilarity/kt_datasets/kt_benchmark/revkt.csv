main-captions	0082	2.500	In a supervised learning model, the algorithm learns on a labeled dataset, providing an answer key that the algorithm can use to evaluate its accuracy on training data while in An unsupervised model, in contrast, provides unlabeled data that the algorithm tries to make sense of by extracting features and patterns on its own.	Unsupervised model, the algorithm provides unlabeled data that the algorithm tries to make sense of by extracting features and patterns on its own.
